Cs-255 Project 2
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was the owner of driverpass. The owner wanted to design a system application on a website to help drivers with their drivers test. The client believes that the students are not getting the proper training to pass their driving test. The system is being designed so that the students can create an account and schedule practices driving test, and exams. 
What did you do particularly well?
I think I worked on the functional and non-functional requirements and creating the UML diagrams particulary well. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would revise the the designing the business requirements of this system. I would improve it by reviewing the doucments more throughly to ensure I was gathering all the needed requirements. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I intrepreted the user's needs by breaking down each users requirements to understand all of the requirements that were required for the system. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing the system because it will allow for the programmer to understand all of the requirements. Also the users  requirements are so important because without theproper requirements the project will not be useful to them, therefore the project will not be able to be created if the user requirements are not understood. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In designing the software I would first want to get the requirements of the new functionalities of the system.  Then I would design the system and add the new features. When I am wanting to analyze in the future I will have other programmers look at my work to gather feedback.
